# üéì LearnFlow ‚Äì AI-Powered Learning Platform
 
 ## üìå Project Overview
 
 *LearnFlow* is an AI-driven educational platform designed to enhance and personalize the learning experience.It revolutionizes online learning by automating content summarization and interactive study aids. It comprises two main modules:
 
 ### üõ° 1. Battleground
 Transform *YouTube videos, **documents, or **topics* into interactive AI-generated *quizzes*. Features include:
 - Personalized quizzes to reinforce learning.
 - Instant feedback to assess understanding.
 - Real-time interaction with the *Master Teacher AI Assistant* for tailored guidance.
 
 *Live Demo*: [Battleground Module](https://learnflowai1.netlify.app/)
 
 ### üèï 2. Barrack
 Convert any content into:
 - *Flashcards* for quick revisions.
 - *Study Notes* to summarize key points.
 - *Multiplayer Quizzes* for collaborative learning.
 
 Barrack promotes faster learning, real-time collaboration, and makes studying engaging and fun.
 
 *Live Demo*: [Barrack Module](https://learnflowai2.netlify.app/)

 > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Ensure that both applications run on different ports to avoid conflicts. You can start one of them on a different port using:
 ```bash
 npm run dev -- --port=5174
 ```
 This command will launch the app on `http://localhost:5174`
 ```
